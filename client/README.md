# Stockcarter Frontend

## Overview

This is the frontend for the "Stockcarter" project, a web application designed to analyze trades and compare the performance of a user's portfolio against benchmarks such as the S&P 500. The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, and styled with TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern UI.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds types to make the code more robust and understandable.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed (preferably the latest LTS version). You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://yourrepository.com/stockcarter-frontend.git
   cd stockcarter-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see the app in action, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile your application and output the production-ready files in the `dist/` directory.
